# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
* The purpose of this analysis is to create an app for a travel website that allows it's users to filter searches based on their ideal climate in order to retreive destinations that meet their search criterea. From this point, users will be able to search a Google Map in order to find where they would like to travel to. Once the user selects their travel destination, they will then be able to see their filtered results, on Google Maps, with pop-up markers which include information about the nearest hotel, country, city, and current weather conditions. Finally, the user will be able to plan a travel itinerary with directions using Google Maps.
